### Challange Details ðŸ”¥
---

In this challenge, we have a Node.js application that is in the development process but that already has the necessary tests to do all the requirements validation (you shouldn't mess with the tests).

After some changes in the application code, part of the tests stopped passing and now only you can solve this problem. Let's go there?

This application performs the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) of project repositories. In addition, it is possible to like in registered repositories, increasing the number of likes by 1 each time the route is called.
